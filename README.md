
# Keyboard Snippet Bot
A minimal and lightning-fast Python tool that automatically replaces typed commands with predefined text or code
snippets. Perfect for quickly inserting reusable content anywhere â€“ terminal, editor, browser, and more.

## Usage

Usage of the bot is super easy. All you have to do, is set up your key combination, that is implemented on the top of the *main.py* file.
Then, you fill up the *snippet.txt* file with any content you want. From now on, anytime you type your combination, the snippet will paste in the position of your pointer.
